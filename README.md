<h1>"My mind rebels at stagnation."</h1>
<br>Current mini-project is <b>a guide on swapping to Linux from Windows via GitHub Pages</b>. Serves to help others, collect information I gave to friends in a singular website and to familiarise myself with Git.
<br>Also learning <b>Rust</b>. Once confident, a personal goal is to rewrite Frosty Mod Manager (just MM for now) as a native Linux program, depending on how long their rewrite takes.
