# "My mind rebels at stagnation."
<br>Current mini-project is <b>a guide on swapping to Linux from Windows via GitHub Pages</b>. Serves to help others, collect information I gave to friends in a singular website and to familiarise myself with Git. Haven't done very much of it admittedly (me when i have ADHD) but I'll get around to it soon (22/08/2025, hold me to this).
<br>Now a part of the [AmbleLabs](https://github.com/amblelabs) organisation to work on the Adventures in Time Wiki.
